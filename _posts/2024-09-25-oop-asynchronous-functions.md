## Introduction To Object Oriented Programming

### Object Oriented Programming
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm in computer science that relies on the concept of classes and objects. It is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprints (usually called classes), which are used to create individual instances of objects.

### Building blocks of OOP
Classes
- a blueprint of an object
Objects 
- an instance of a class
Methods 
- methods represent behaviors
Attributes 
- information to be stored in a class about an object
