## Learning Objectives

- To introduce Dart as a modern, object-oriented, and statically typed programming language.
- To install the Dart SDK and set up Visual Studio Code for Dart development.
- To understand basic Dart syntax, including variables, data types, and operators.
- To learn about control flow statements (if, else, switch, loops) in Dart.


## Introduction to Dart

Dart is an open-source programming language developed by Google. It is used to create mobile, web and desktop applications. It is also used to develop server-side applications. Dart is a strongly typed language, which means that the compiler will detect any errors in the code before the code is compiled.


Currently, Dart is one of the most preferred languages to learn. A solid understanding of Dart is necessary to develop high-quality apps with flutter. According to Github, Dart is one of the most loved programming languages in the world.

If you know languages like C, Java, C#, Javascript, etc. Dart will be easy for you. This course covers Dart and flutter from basic to advanced.

Dart is a powerful and versatile language that can be used for a wide range of applications. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced programmer, it's worth taking the time to learn this language. It's sure to become an important part of your development toolkit.

### Dart Features 

  Dart also has several features that make it easier to learn and use compared to other languages. For example, it has a simple syntax and a flexible type system. It also has built-in support for asynchronous programming, which makes it easier to write code that runs concurrently. Below are interesting things about Dart:

- Free and open-source.
- Object-oriented programming language.
- Used to develop android, iOS, web, and desktop apps fast.
- Can compile to either native code or javascript.
- Offers modern programming features like null safety and asynchronous programming.
- You can even use Dart for servers and backend.

### Why Learn Dart?

There are several reasons why learning Dart can be beneficial:

- Easy to Learn: Dart has a clean and intuitive syntax, making it easy for beginners to grasp the basics of programming.
- Fast Development: Dart offers a range of features and tools that enable rapid development, allowing developers to build applications more efficiently.
- Platform-Independent: Dart can be used to develop applications for various platforms, including web, mobile, and desktop, making it a versatile language.
- Strong Type System: Dart has a strong type system that helps catch errors at compile-time, resulting in more reliable and bug-free code.


## Installing Dart

There are multiple ways to install a dart sdk on your system. You can install Dart on Windows, Mac, and Linux or run it from the browser.
